Welcome to the UNITE Toolbox's documentation!
=============================================
The **UNITE Toolbox** is a Python library for incorporating *Information Theory* to any data analysis and/or modelling workflows. 
The toolbox collects different estimation methods for information-theoretic quantities, and brings them together in an easy to use Python package with a simple interface.

Current available methods:
   * Histograms or "binning"
   * Kernel based estimation (KDE)
   * *k*-nearest neighbors estimation (*k*-NN)

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including how to
:ref:`install <installation>` the project.

   This project is under active development.
